# Self-Supervised Learning for Graph Dataset Condensation
This is the Pytorch implementation of KDD'24 work: "Self-Supervised Learning for Graph Dataset Condensation".

## Requirements
- Pytorch==2.0.1
- torch-geometric==2.3.1
- ogb

## Instructions
### SGDC
We provide the shell  scripts in "command.sh" to run the code on NCI1 and ogbg-molhiv dataset.

Kindly note, the file "pretrain" includes the target embeddings, which are generated by [GraphCL](https://github.com/Shen-Lab/GraphCL). So you can generate any target embeddings for your own datasets.

### SGDC-Att
The code of attention-based neural network kernel is in "antk.py", you can change the graph kernel in model training (line 210 in main.py).

### SGDC-CL
We also implement the code for initial design, SGDC-CL, in "UnspervisedGM/" folder.
